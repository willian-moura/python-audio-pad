# python-audio-pad
  ![Python SoundTable](/images/example.png)
***

The mainly goal for this application is to simulate a sound table, offering to the user 24 channels, where each one can:
- play/pause the track in the selected channel;
- stop the track completely (not being able to continue the track);
- loop the track, starting again it after finish;
- adjust the channel volume;
- remove/closes the current channel's track, letting it free to receive new track.

The audio files must be first added to the list at the left side, that has the following options:
- Add: add a audio file to the list;
- Del: deletes a audio file from the list;
- Musics: add a file audio selected to the first free channel available in the Musics section;
- Environments: add file audio selected to the first free channel available in the Environments section;

**The application only accepts OFF or WAV files**, to MP3 files, convert them using the converter available in the application.

## Using in the RPG
The Python SoundTable works very well to the RPG (tabletop roleplaying games) sound environment, giving the control to many audio tracks simultaneously, what it's perfect to who needs play a opening door effect while play a background music, for example.
